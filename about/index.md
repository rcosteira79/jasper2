## Me

Hi! I'm Ricardo. I'm a software engineer from Portugal, currently living in the magical city of Coimbra (the one pictured in the home page). I'm shy at first and have a natural resting bitch face, but when you talk to me you'll soon find out that I'm actually nice and funny (I'm way too proud of my sense of humor).

I've done practically everything in software: from backend to frontend, from data-centric security to developing apps for aging people that don't even have the notion of what is a "button" in terms of an application. I've seen some sh\*t, but ever since I found about it years ago (back in the ICS days), Android is my one true love.

As a developer, I:

- Think that the best software is the one that works;
- Understand that **technical debt** is the second constant in software development (**change** being the first);
- Am used to work with both legacy code (AsyncTasks, anyone?) and hip new tech that kids use these days (Rx, Jetpack, DI frameworks, etc);
- Love Kotlin (but remember Java for all good things it did for me, in spite of all the bad ones);
- Have a deep care for software architecture and love to refactor accordingly.

At the header of this page, you have links for my GitHub, Twitter and Linkedin. Feel free to reach out!

## The blog

This blog is a somewhat lightweight version of [Jasper2](https://github.com/jekyller/jasper2), a Jekyll port of [Ghost's default theme Casper v2](https://github.com/tryghost/casper). My purpose with the blog is twofold: to use it as a place where I can write about anything I want (mostly Android) and to use it as a personal website where I can aggregate my "digital footprint" - hence the links for other platforms.
